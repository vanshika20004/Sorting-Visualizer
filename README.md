# Sorting Visualizer
A web-based interactive sorting algorithm visualizer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms through animation, statistics tracking, and real-time code highlighting.

## 🚀 Features
  ### Select from multiple sorting algorithms:

    -> Bubble Sort

    -> Selection Sort

    -> Insertion Sort

    -> Merge Sort

    -> Quick Sort

    -> Heap Sort

    -> Jump Sort

    -> Count Sort

  ### 🎛 Adjustable:

    -> Array size (via slider)

    -> Sorting speed (via slider)

  ### ✍️ Enter your own custom array (comma-separated)

  ### 📊 Real-time tracking of:

    -> Time Complexity

    -> Space Complexity

    -> Number of Comparisons

    -> Number of Swaps

  ### 🧾 Code snippets displayed and highlighted live during sorting

  ### 🎨 Clean and responsive UI for desktop and mobile

## 🛠 Technologies Used
    -> HTML5

    -> CSS3 (Flexbox, Transitions, Media Queries)

    -> Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Asynchronous Animations)

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
    1. Open index.html in your browser.

    2. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown.

    3. Adjust the array size and speed using sliders.

    4. Click Generate New Array or enter a custom array.

    5. Press Start Sorting to begin visualization.

    6. Use Pause, Resume, or Reset anytime.

## 📚 Educational Value
    -> Ideal for students and beginners learning sorting algorithms.

    -> Offers a clear visual explanation of algorithm behavior.

    -> Helps understand time and space complexity in action.

# 📌 Note
    -> Jump Sort is not a conventional sorting algorithm; it's included for experimental or illustrative purposes.

    -> Count Sort works only for non-negative integers with relatively small values.
