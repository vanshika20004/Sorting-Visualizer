# Sorting Visualizer
A web-based interactive sorting algorithm visualizer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms through animation, statistics tracking, and real-time code highlighting.

## 🚀 Features
🔘 Select from multiple sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Jump Sort

Count Sort

## 🎛 Adjustable:

Array size (via slider)

Sorting speed (via slider)

✍️ Enter your own custom array (comma-separated)

📊 Real-time tracking of:

Time Complexity

Space Complexity

Number of Comparisons

Number of Swaps

🧾 Code snippets displayed and highlighted live during sorting

🎨 Clean and responsive UI for desktop and mobile

## 🛠 Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3 (Flexbox, Transitions, Media Queries)

Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Asynchronous Animations)

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
Open index.html in your browser.

Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown.

Adjust the array size and speed using sliders.

Click Generate New Array or enter a custom array.

Press Start Sorting to begin visualization.

Use Pause, Resume, or Reset anytime.

## 📚 Educational Value
Ideal for students and beginners learning sorting algorithms.

Offers a clear visual explanation of algorithm behavior.

Helps understand time and space complexity in action.

# 📌 Note
Jump Sort is not a conventional sorting algorithm; it's included for experimental or illustrative purposes.

Count Sort works only for non-negative integers with relatively small values.
